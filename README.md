#tenhou-log-collector

A tool for collecting log links and downloading actual log files from Tenhou's Mahjong clients.

Tenhou's Windows (premium) client and flash clients only store game links of 20-40 most recent games. This tool will collect those links and save them in a separate file so that they never get deleted. It also downloads the actual log files to your computer. You can make it run automatically on system startup so that you will not have to worry about losing game logs ever again. 

The log collector will look for logs in Flash's local storage as well as Windows client's directory. Collected game links are stored in the file logs.csv, in the same directory as the tool. This file can be opened by Excel or any text editor such as Notepad. Downloaded log files are stored in the directory "mjlog" by default. 

```
Usage: tenhoulogcollector [--nowait] [-d directory]
        --nowait          Do not require the user to press a key at the end of the program
		-d, --directory   Specify directory to store the log files (default: "mjlog")
```

Operating systems supported: Windows XP and higher.

Simply download tenhoulogcollector.exe, move it to the desired directory, and run it.

###plot_rating
plot_rating is a compiled Matlab script that makes a rating graph using information from the logs. To run it, you need to have either Matlab or Matlab Runtime (R2015a 32-bit) installed. Matlab Runtime can be downloaded [here](https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2015a/deployment_files/R2015a/installers/win32/MCR_R2015a_win32_installer.exe) (688 MB). The script plot_rating uses information in logs.csv generated by tenhoulogcollector and produces a graph as a PNG image named "rating_plot" in the same directory as the script. plot_rating does not take any argument.
