#tenhou-log-collector

A tool for collecting log links and downloading actual log files from Tenhou's Mahjong clients.

Tenhou's flash clients only store game links of 20 most recent games. This tool will collect those links and save them in a separate file so that they never get deleted. It also downloads the actual log files to your computer. You can make it run automatically on system startup so that you will not have to worry about losing game logs ever again. The Windows client stores 40 most recent games but can be configured to download the log files to your computer, so you would not need this tool if you use the Windows client.

The log collector will look for logs in Flash's local storage as well as Windows client's directory. Collected game links are stored in the file logs.csv, in the same directory as the tool. This file can be opened by Excel or any text editor such as Notepad. Downloaded log files are stored in the directory "mjlog" by default.

The logs.csv file contains your rank and rating, among other things, so you can make pretty plots like this:
